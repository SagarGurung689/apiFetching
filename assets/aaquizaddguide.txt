Welcome to loksewa tayari quiz Database. In this guide you will learn how you can add quiz to the loksewa tayari quiz Database

1. Make sure that git is installed on your computer and you have basic knowledge of git.
2. Now you can see file named called aa-QUIZ_format file listed in assests directory copy the file content.
3. Now create a new json file and paste the format and input required question options and answers.


//Naming conventions strictly for this project//

-For computer operator mcq: Json filename format must be computeroperator1.json, computeroperator2.json, computeroperator3.json, computeroperator4.json  and so on.
-For engineering mcq: json filename format must be civileng1.json, civileng2.json, civileng3.json, civileng4.json  and so on.

Make sure that same file name is not repeated for example there are already sets upto civileng8.json next file name should be civileng9.json.

// Instructions while adding a question

1. Question must be one line if it is in two line while paste remove the spaces ahead of 2nd line and make it go in first line.
2. If there is "" in the question use \(this slash) before  using "" in the question.

example: sample question "question": "Who said this famous saying "Code never lies but comments sometimes do" " 
In this case use \" like this  "question": "Who said this famous saying \"Code never lies but comments sometimes do\" " 

** same for any error for symbol you encounter

3. Make sure that there is no empty space between options and ansers

Example :   Having empty space
// wrong structure
"a": "Salt glazing is used",
            "b": "Lead glazing is used  ", // having empty space at the end
            "c": "   Opaque glazing is used",// having empty  space at the beginning
            "d": "None of these"


            // Correct structure

            "a": "Salt glazing is used", // no space between quotation and options
            "b": "Lead glazing is used",
            "c": "Opaque glazing is used",
            "d": "None of these"
